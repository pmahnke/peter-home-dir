Revision history for Data::Buffer

0.04  2001.07.27
    - Added new_with_init.
    - Added set_offset and reset_offset.

0.03  2001.07.13
    - Fixed bug in get_int8 and put_int8; was using signed char ('c'),
      should have been using unsigned char ('C').
    - Added get_bytes and put_bytes; the first grabs a number of bytes
      from the buffer and returns them, the latter appends bytes into
      the buffer.
    - Added extract, which grabs a piece of the buffer and returns a
      new buffer containing that chunk, updating the offset in the
      original buffer.
