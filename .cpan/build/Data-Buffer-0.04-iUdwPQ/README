This is Data::Buffer.

PREREQUISITES

None.

INSTALLATION

Data::Buffer installation is straightforward. If your cpan shell
is set up, you should just be able to do

    % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Data::Buffer'

If you don't like that, you can download the distribution; the
latest version on CPAN can be found in

    ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/B/BT/BTROTT/

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install
