By clicking below, you can download a copy of our Least Cost Charge Calculation Program. The program is set to allow you to make 10 charge calculations.<BR><BR>

There are several reasons why you should take a look at our program. 

<ol>
<li> You will be able to see how the program functions.
<li> You will immediately see how easy it will be for you to use.
<li> You can use the program to calculate least cost charges using your actual melt stock chemistries and melting specifications.
</ol>

<h2>Try this</h2>

Suppose you have a recipe that you feel is cost effective. Using the program, you should enter the chemistries and costs of the melt stocks in your recipe and the desired upper and lower limits for all of the elements you are considering in your desired chemistry.<BR><BR>

We guarantee that the program will calculate a different combination of the melt stocks than you now are using. This different combination will give a lower cost recipe that will still result in an in specification furnace chemistry.<BR><BR>

After you have tried this with some of your cost effective recipes and seen how easy it is to calculate less expensive recipes, you should enter some additional melt stocks. The program will now have more melt stocks to consider and will calculate even lower cost recipes.<BR><BR>

While you are doing your first 10 calculations, we will work on the integration of your spectrometer with the program. When your spectometer is integrated with our program you can do fast, accurate and complete final addition calculations. This means just one set of final additions is required. This will reduce the time it takes to turn your furnaces.<BR><BR>
