<hr size=1 width=100%>
  
<font class=large>
<p>Integration of the Least Cost Charge Calculation Program with a spectrometer means that the chemistry of your most recent sample is automatically passed from your spectrometer software. This means that you can do final addition calculations without reentering the chemistry of your sample. When a sample chemistry is passed from your spectrometer software, the Least Cost Charge Calculation program starts in the final addition calculation mode. Only a three mouse clicks are need to perform a final addition calculation.</P>

<P>The integration with your spectrometer is quite straight forward. 
You need to supply a copy of the chemistry history file that your spectrometer 
produces along with the name of the manufacturer and the model name of your spectrometer 
and the version of the software used on your spectrometer. 
The spectrometer chemistry history file needs to be plain ASCII text. 
Non plain ASCII text files are not useable. </p>
<p>If you can find a plain text file in your spectrometer directory that either has the most 
recent sample chemistry or has multiple sample chemistries with the most recent sample chemistry 
at the end of the file, then that file can most likely be used. A plain text file is a file you 
can read in an editor such as MS Word or MS NotePad and all of the characters are letters, 
digits or punctuation marks.</p> 
<p>There is an integration with Belec Spectrometers.</p>
<p>Integration with recent Spectro spectrometers is very easy. Integration with the Baird Spectrovac 2000 Model number DV5 using software written in Pascal is not possible.
</P>
<P>The required code to integrate with your spectrometer will be added to the program and you will recieve an updated version of the program.</p>
