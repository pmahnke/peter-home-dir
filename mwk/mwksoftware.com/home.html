 <p><font size=4 > My supervisors are now using it for each and every heat that they run and they seem to like it. A lot of pulling teeth to get them to use it but once they did they realized that it is easier than guessing and hoping it's right. And I get a lot less calls in the middle of the night now. lol</p>

<p>This is what you should do: </p>
<UL>
<Li>1. Gather the information you use to make charge calculations. This would be the elements you consider, the chemistries of the materials you use to charge your furnace and the specifications of the alloys you make. 
<p> </P>
<Li>2. Download our program and install the program on your computer. 
The installation is a conventional InstallShield program. 
<p> </P>

<Li>3. If you need assistance just give us a call at +1 414-355-5330. 
<p> </P>
<Li>4. You will enter the element symbols for the elements you use; enter the chemistries of the materials you use to charge your furnace; and enter the specification for an alloy you make.
 
<p> </P>
<Li>5. Now you are ready to calculate a least cost charge. 
You can compare this calculation with the recipe that you used and you will see exactly what your cost savings will be. 
<p> </P>

<Li>6. This entire procedure will take about an hour. 
<p> </P>

<Li>7. Take a look at the Tutorial to see the screens that are used and how easy it is to get started with our program.
