<h1>About Least Cost Charge Calculations</h1>
    <hr size=1 width=100%>

  
<p>Least cost charge calculation recipes are not junky, cheap recipes with every tramp element at its maximum or a barely acceptable chemistry for the important elements. On the contrary, the recipes our program produces will result in higher quality alloys with less variation in the chemistry of your alloys from one batch to the next.</p>

<p>The reason is the calculational sophistication of the linear programming method that our program uses. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that your spreadsheet program can even come close to calculating the lower cost, high quality recipes that you should be using.</p>

<p>If you are pouring iron based alloys, of any kind, copper based or titanium based alloys then you really need to use our program to remain competitive in the world casting market. Foundry after foundry has found that our program will pay for itself in less than a week and less than one day in many cases.</p>

<p>Our customers were not pouring junky, low quality alloys. They were working just as hard as you are to do a good job. The cost savings comes from the vastly improved method of calculating charges.</p>

<p>Our customers have commented that our program is easy to use. But, if you have a problem, assistance is just a phone call away, 24 hours a day. We will answer the phone and get your question answered. There’s no passing you off to higher level support or putting you on hold. Do you have any other software where customer support is offered 24 hours a day by the person who wrote the software?</p>

<p>Download the demonstration program. Give it a try. Call us if you have any questions. Start using the only charge calculation method that will give you the lowest cost, highest quality charge recipes.</p>
