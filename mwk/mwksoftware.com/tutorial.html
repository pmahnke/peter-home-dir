<h1>Program Tutorial</h1>
<hr size=1 width=100%>

<p>The following is a step by step of how to use our Least Cost Charge Calculation Program.<BR>
This tutorial is designed to show you how to begin using our program and how easy it is to<BR>
calculate least cost charges. These are actual screen shots from the program.</P>

<table width=75% border=1 cellspacing=0>

<tr>
 <td>
<P>This is the Charge Calculation screen, the main screen of the program.</p>
<p> You access all of the program functions from here. Some data has <BR> already been entered. 
The first thing you need to do is enter the element symbols you consider.</p>
<p>You do this by clicking on Data, in the menu bar at the top of the screen of the screen, and then on Setup.</P>

<p>This screen will appear and you need to enter the password which is MWK.</p>
<p>Then click on Continue</p>

 <td>
<p>This is the program setup screen. This is where you enter the elements you use. There are<BR>
 other entries you may make. There is a explanation for every entry. Just move your cursor to<BR>
 the entry to see the explanation. We will skip the other entries for now. </p>
<p> You can also click on Help / User Manual on the main screen to access the User Manual</p>
<p>When you are finished click on Update Information in the lower left hand corner</P>

 <td>
<P>We are back at the Charge Calculation screen.</p>
<P>The information on this screen is data from the spectrometer integration. The Comments <BR>
are information from the spectrometer about the last sample chemistry. The weight of the<BR>
metal in the furnace has been entered and the calculation mode is Final Additions Calculations.<BR>
All the user needs to do is click  on continue and a Final Additions calculation will be made.</p> 
<p>Now you want to click on Data / Melt Stocks in the menu bar.</p>
<p> This will take you to the screen where you enter the information for some melt stocks.</p>
<p>Melt Stocks are all of the materials you put in your furnace.</p>
<a href="v65main.jpg"><img src="v65main.jpg"></a>
 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>
<p>This is the Melt Stock Access screen and you can see some melt stocks have already been entered.<p>
<p>To enter a new melt stock click on Add A Melt Stock at the lower left of the screen.</p>

<tr>
 <td>
<p>This is Melt Stock or Furnace Charge Maintenance screen where you enter and modify melt <BR>
stock information.</p>

<p>As you can see the information for a melt stock has already been entered. </p>
<p>To create a new melt stock entry just enter a name and a cost for the melt stock. Then enter<BR>
 the chemistry for the melt stock.</p>
<p>The value for the last element, Ni in this case, will be calculated for you.<p>
<p>Leave the amount on hand at NoLimit and ignore the recovery percents and other entries for now.</P>
<p>The entry for Ni will be calculated when you click on Update Information.<p>
<p> When you are finished click on Return which takes you to the Melt Stock Access Screen. You may<BR>
continue entering melt stock information or you can return to the Charge Calculation Screen.</p>

 </td>
</tr>


<tr>
 <td>
<p>Continue to click on Data / Melt Stocks to enter the information about your melt stocks.</p>
<p>You should enter the information on all of the melt stocks you used for a recent charge.</p>
<p>When you have entered your melt stock information you will be able to calculate a least cost <BR>
charge and compare it with the recipe you used.</p>
<p>When you are finished entering melt stock information click on Data / Furnace Ranges on <BR>
the Main Screen to enter the information for a Furnace Range, the specifications for the<BR>
 alloy you are making.</p>
<p>This is the Furnace Range access screen. Click on Add A Furnace Range at the bottom of the <BR>
 screen to add a Furnace Range.</p>

 <td>
<p>This screen is where you enter information for a new furnace range / grade.</p>
<p>All you need to do is give the furnace range / grade a name and enter the lower and upper limit<BR>
 for each element. Ignore the recovery percents and other entries for now.</p>
<p>You can specify an aim for an element by making the upper and lower limits equal.</p>
<p>You should specify an upper limit for each element that is greater than zero.</p>
<p>The program will calculate the entries for the last element, Ni, when you click on Update<BR>
 Information</p>
<p>Click on Return when you are finished</p>

 <td>
<p>Here we are at the Charge Calculation screen again. Enter the size of the charge, in this<BR>
 case 10,770 kilograms. 22 melt stocks have been selected and the furnace range is 630 (Hot Test).</p>
<p>Note that a Charge Calculation has been selected for Type of Charge. Click on Continue to<BR>
 calculate the charge. The calculation requires a small fraction of a second to complete.</p>

<p>You may print the report by clicking on Print Report.<p>
<p>Clicking on Return returns you to the Charge Calculation screen.</p>
