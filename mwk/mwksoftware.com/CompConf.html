<P>Support via telephone and email is one way to help you use the program effectively. 
There is a better way and that way is computer conferencing. Computer conferencing allows me 
to see your screen as you are using the program. I can then guide you much more effectively on 
how to best use the program.</P>

<p> If your company already has computer conferencing software then we can use that. Otherwise we 
can use TeamViewer.</p>

<p>Team viewer is very easy to use. I will send you and email that has a link to the meeting I 
have set up. When you click on that link you will be prompted to download and install the TeamViewer 
software. You may also need to give the TeamViewer software access to the internet through your 
fire wall. All of this takes just a minute or two.</p>

<p>Using TeamViewer I can help you with any questions or problems you have. You will be able to use 
the program and every feature correctly.</p>
