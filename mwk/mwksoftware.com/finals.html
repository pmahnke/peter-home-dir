<h1>Final Additions</h1>
<hr size=1 width=100%>

<font class=large>

<P>Final additions calculations require just a few mouse clicks. That's all. 
The first click gets the sample chemistries from your spectrometer.
 The second click selects which sample chemistry you want to use. 
The third click starts the calculation and the results are displayed 
on the screen in the blink of an eye.</P>

<P>The furnace range / grade name that you are making is extracted from the spectrometer information 
along with the weight of your furnace / ladle. This information is used by the program to 
calculate your final additions. The appropriate melt stocks / alloys to be used for the final 
additions and the furnace range / grade specifications are set up automatically. The program 
can also automatically select the appropriate carbon equivalent, hardness (ASTM 255) requirement
 or any other additional constraint. No data entry by the operator is required. Just three mouse 
clicks and the calculation is done.</P>

<P>You need the ability to calculate least cost final additions, even if you use certified ingot.</p>

<P>You may already have software that calculates final additions. Often this software is deficient because it takes more than one try to get the final chemistry correct. This means you take a sample, calculate the needed additions, add the corrections, take another sample and find that your chemistry is still not correct.</P>

<P>This is pretty expensive. You have to hold hot longer than you should and you can’t turn your furnaces as often.</P>

<P>Our program will calculate the least cost final additions that are needed the first time. This means you save on holding hot costs and you can turn your furnaces faster. The reduction in your costs from calculating final additions correctly the first time should pay for the program in just one day.</P>

<P>None of our customers have ever mentioned that our program is not able to calculate the correct final additions in one try. We are sure they would complain quite loudly if there was a problem.</P>
<p>The result of the calculation is a printed list of final additions. This list can be added to the documentation for the castings. The printed list is much more legible than a hand written list which means fewer errors. </p>
<p>You will see a significant reduction in alloy chemistry variance. The final chemistry will be exactly the required chemistry, not close and not just within spec but exactly what is required. Reduction of variance is a central concern of quality control.  </p>
<p>Not all of your customers may want the same chemistry for a given alloy type. Automated final additions means you can easily accommodate your customers' preferences.  </p>
<p>Anyone can do the three mouse clicks required for a final addition calculation. This means higher priced personnel can be used more cost effectively elsewhere.  </p>
<p>Automated final additions take at most ten seconds. That is faster than anyone can manually calculate final additions. Again, production rates are improved.  </p>

<p>The installation program download file size is about 2.5 MB.<BR><BR></p>

<p><A HREF="installv65finalsdemo.exe">Click here to download Final Additions demo program installation program</A> </P>
<P>Once you have downloaded the installation program, simply execute the program to begin the installation of the FInal Additions Program.</P>

<h1>Here's how to get started: </h1>
<p>You should download the demo program to your computer and get it set up and running on your computer. Then you can install the program to your spectrometer computer. </p>
<p>Take a look at the tutorial on the website. Basically you want to enter the elements you shoot for on your spectrometer on the Program Setup screen. </p>
<p>Then you want to enter the chemistries and costs of the materials you use for final additions. That might be high carbon ferro chrome but you would not include returns. The default inventory amount is NoLimit as the assumption is that you will always have the final additions materials available. </p>
<p>Now enter a Furnace Range, alloy specification, for an alloy you make. Be sure to enter a non zero upper limit for each element. Suppose you shoot for tungsten, W. If you have an upper limit of zero for W and your sample has 0.0001 you will end up with an invalid calculation as there is no way to dilute the W to zero. </p>
<p>Now create another melt stock that has the chemistry of one of your typical samples. You should make the chemistry OK, with in range, for all of the elements and just a bit low for one element. Select this melt stock as the chemistry of the current furnace. </p>
<p>Now you are ready for a final additions calculation. Enter the weight of the current furnace on the main screen and click on Continue. The report will show you what to add to correct the Current Furnace chemistry to the correct chemistry as specified in the Furnace Range, alloy specification. </p>
<p>You might do some more experimenting at this point but you are also ready to install the Final Additions Program on your spectrometer computer. Just install the program on the spectrometer computer the same way you installed it on your computer. Then copy all of the .dat files from the installation directory, generally c: \ MWK Software to the same directory on your spectrometer computer. </p>
<p>Picking the correct integration with your spectrometer software can be tricky but you can always call, +1 414-355-5330 or send an email.  </p>
