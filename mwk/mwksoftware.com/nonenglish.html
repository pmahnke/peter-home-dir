<P>Alas, The program is available only in English. It is possible to use the program effectively even if your employees have a very limited ability in English. </P>

<P>Because Final Additions Calculations are so simple, you can write a short, step by step description of how to do them. You can print screen shots and write translations on the printed output. (See below for instructions on printing screen shots)</P>
<p>If your employees are able to operate your spectrometer then they will be able to use the Final Additions Program to calculate final additions.</p>
<p>You can also print screen shots with translations and write simple instructions for other screens used by the program.</p>

<h3>Printing Screen Shots</h3>
<p>Press the Alt Key and then the Print Screen Key. An image of the current screen will be created 
that you can use in a text editor such as MS Word. Now Open MS Word and click on the Paste 
Icon. The screen shot you just captured will appear and you can print the screen shot along 
with any instructions you wish to add.</p>
