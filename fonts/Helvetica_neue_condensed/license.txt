NOTICE TO USER: 
THIS IS A CONTRACT. BY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE BELOW, YOU 
ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF 
YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS 
AGREEMENT, DECLINE WHERE INSTRUCTED, AND YOU WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO USE THE SOFTWARE.

This Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe") End User License 
Agreement accompanies software ("Software") and related 
explanatory written materials ("Documentation"). The term 
"Software" shall also include any upgrades, modified 
versions, updates, additions, and copies of the Software 
licensed to you by Adobe. Adobe grants to you a nonexclusive 
license to use the Software and Documentation, provided that 
you agree to the following:

1. Use of the Software. 
You may--

- Install the Software in a single location on a hard disk 
or other storage device of up to the number of computers 
indicated at the top of this Agreement ("Permitted Number 
of Computers"). 

- Provided the Software is configured for network use, 
install and use the Software on a single file server for 
use on a single local area network for either (but not 
both) of the following purposes: 

	(1) permanent installation onto a hard disk or other 
storage device of up to the Permitted Number of 
Computers; or 

	(2) use of the Software over such network, provided the 
number of different computers on which the Software is 
used does not exceed the Permitted Number of Computers. 
For example, if there are 100 computers connected to the 
server, with no more than 15 computers ever using the 
Software concurrently, but the Software will be used on 
25 different computers at various times, the Permitted 
Number of Computers for which you need a license is 25. 

- Display, modify, reproduce and distribute any photographs, 
clip art or other artistic works, in whole or in part, 
that are included with the Software (unless a specific 
notice to the contrary is indicated), provided such 
photographs, clip art or artistic works are not 
distributed on a stand-alone basis.  Such photographs, 
clip art and artistic works may not be used in the 
production of lewd, obscene or pornographic material.

- Make one backup copy of the Software, provided your backup 
copy is not installed or used on any computer. 

HOME USE.  The primary user of each computer on which the 
Software is installed or used may also install the Software 
on one home or portable computer. However, the Software may 
not be used on the secondary computer by another person at 
the same time the Software on the primary computer is being 
used. 

FONT SOFTWARE.  If the Software includes font software, you 
may-- 

- Use the font software as described above on the Permitted 
Number of Computers and output such font software on any 
output devices connected to such computers. 

- If the Number of Permitted Computers is five or fewer, 
download the font software to the memory (hard disk or 
RAM) of one output device connected to at least one of 
such computers for the purpose of having such font 
software remain resident in the output device, and of one 
additional such output device for every multiple of five 
represented by the Number of Permitted Computers. 

- Take a copy of the font(s) you have used for a particular 
file to a commercial printer or other service bureau, and 
such service bureau may use the font(s) to process your 
file, provided such service bureau has informed you that 
it has purchased or been granted a license to use that 
particular font software. 

- Convert and install the font software into another format 
for use in other environments, subject to the following 
conditions: A computer on which the converted font 
software is used or installed shall be considered as one 
of your Permitted Number of Computers. You agree that use 
of the font software you have converted shall be pursuant 
to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, that 
such font software may be used only for your own 
customary internal business or personal use and that such 
font software may not be distributed or transferred for 
any purpose, except in accordance with Paragraph 3 below. 

2. Copyright.
The Software is owned by Adobe and its suppliers, and its 
structure, organization and code are the valuable trade 
secrets of Adobe and its suppliers. The Software is also 
protected by United States Copyright Law and International 
Treaty provisions. You must treat the Software just as you 
would any other copyrighted material, such as a book. You 
may not copy the Software or the Documentation, except as 
set forth in the "Use of the Software" section. Any copies 
that you are permitted to make pursuant to this Agreement 
must contain the same copyright and other proprietary 
notices that appear on or in the Software. Except for font 
software converted to other formats as permitted in the "Use 
of the Software" section, you agree not to modify, adapt or 
translate the Software. You also agree not to reverse 
engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to 
discover the source code of the Software. Trademarks shall 
be used in accordance with accepted trademark practice, 
including identification of trademark owner’s name. 
Trademarks can only be used to identify printed output 
produced by the Software. Such use of any trademark does not 
give you any rights of ownership in that trademark. Except 
as stated above, this Agreement does not grant you any 
intellectual property rights in the Software.  

3. Transfer.
You may not rent, lease, sublicense or lend the Software or 
Documentation. You may, however, transfer all your rights to 
use the Software to another person or legal entity provided 
that you transfer this Agreement, the Software, including 
all copies, updates and prior versions and all copies of 
font software converted into other formats, and all 
Documentation to such person or entity and that you retain 
no copies, including copies stored on a computer. 

4. Multiple Environment Software/Multiple Language 
Software/Dual Media Software/Multiple Copies/Upgrades.
If the Software includes, or, in connection with the 
acquisition of the Software you receive, two or more 
operating environment versions of the Software (e.g. 
Macintosh® and Windows® ), two or more language translation 
versions of the Software, the same Software on two or more 
media (e.g., diskettes and a CD-ROM), and/or you otherwise 
receive two or more copies of the Software, the total 
aggregate number of computers on which all versions of the 
Software are used may not exceed the Permitted Number of 
Computers.  By way of example, if you download an electronic 
copy of the Software from the Internet or another source, 
and in connection with your acquisition of such downloaded 
copy you are also provided a copy of the Software on a 
tangible storage medium, the total aggregate number of 
computers on which all copies of the Software are used may 
not exceed the Permitted Number of Computers expressed in 
this Agreement, notwithstanding the fact that you may have 
been asked to accept End User License Agreements totaling a 
greater Permitted Number of Computers.  You may make one 
back-up copy, in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement, for each version of the Software you use. You may 
not rent, lease, sublicense, lend or transfer versions or 
copies of the Software you do not use, or Software contained 
on any unused media, except as part of the permanent 
transfer of all Software and Documentation as described 
above. If you acquire an upgrade or update for Software, you 
may use the previous version for ninety (90) days after you 
receive the new version in order to assist you in the 
transition to the new version, after which time you no 
longer have a license to use the previous version. 

5. Limited Warranty.
Adobe warrants to you that the Software will perform 
substantially in accordance with the Documentation for the 
ninety (90) day period following your receipt of the 
Software. This warranty does not apply to font software 
converted into other formats. To make a warranty claim, you 
must return the Software to the location where you obtained 
it along with a copy of your sales receipt within such 
ninety (90) day period. If the Software does not perform 
substantially in accordance with the Documentation, the 
entire and exclusive liability and remedy shall be limited 
to either, at Adobe's option, the replacement of the 
Software or the refund of the license fee you paid for the 
Software. ADOBE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT 
THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE 
SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION. THE FOREGOING STATES THE SOLE AND 
EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR ADOBE'S OR ITS SUPPLIERS' BREACH OF 
WARRANTY. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY, ADOBE 
AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS 
TO NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, 
OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Some states or 
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied 
warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty 
may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you. To 
the extent permissible, any implied warranties are limited 
to ninety (90) days. This warranty gives you specific legal 
rights. You may have other rights which vary from state to 
state or jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For further warranty 
information, please contact Adobe's Customer Support 
Department.

6. Limitation of Liability.
IN NO EVENT WILL ADOBE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS, EVEN IF AN ADOBE 
REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. SOME STATES OR 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF 
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE 
LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

7. Trademark License.
Adobe may provide you with a product signature which you may 
license and use in connection with the Software.  Adobe 
hereby grants you a worldwide, nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, personal right to use any such Software 
product signature supplied by Adobe solely under the license 
terms and conditions accompanying any such product signature 
or published by Adobe.

8. Governing Law and General Provisions.
This Agreement will be governed by the laws in force in the 
State of California excluding the application of its 
conflicts of law rules. This Agreement will not be governed 
by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods, the application of which is 
expressly excluded. If any part of this Agreement is found 
void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of 
the balance of the Agreement, which shall remain valid and 
enforceable according to its terms. You agree that the 
Software will not be shipped, transferred or exported into 
any country or used in any manner prohibited by the United 
States Export Administration Act or any other export laws, 
restrictions or regulations. This Agreement shall 
automatically terminate upon failure by you to comply with 
its terms. This Agreement may only be modified in writing 
signed by an authorized officer of Adobe.
