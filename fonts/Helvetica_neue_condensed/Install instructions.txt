Installing Fonts in ATM Light 4.0 in Windows 95/98 or NT 4

In order to use your PostScript Type 1 fonts in Windows 95, 
Windows 98, or Windows NT 4, you must first install 
Adobe Type Manager® (ATM®), and then install the fonts through ATM. 
ATM version 4.0 or higher is required for Windows 98 and NT 4, 
and 3.02 or higher for Windows 95.

To install Type 1 fonts in Windows 95/98 or Windows NT 4.0 using 
ATM Light 4.0:

1. Choose Start > Programs > Adobe > Adobe Type Manager.

2. In ATM, click the Fonts tab.

3. Choose Browse For Fonts from the Source pop-up menu.

4. Navigate to the folder that contains the fonts you want to install 
   (C:\temp\Adobe unless you told the installer to put them elsewhere). 
   The fonts located in that folder will appear below the folder's name.

5. Select the fonts you want to install. You can click to select one font, 
   Ctrl-click to select several fonts, or Shift-click to select a contiguous 
   group of fonts.

6. Exit ATM.

The fonts are now installed and will appear in the font menus of your 
applications.
