	<p>Hello children and teachers. Welcome to City Zoo. My name is Zahra and I am the zookeeper. I understand you want to know what a zookeeper does each day. To be a zookeeper you need to love animals and have a passion for their welfare and protection. It is a wonderful job. I have a strict routine, but no two days are ever the same as you can never tell what the animals are going to get up to.</p>


	<p>Now, to give you an idea of what it is like to be a zookeeper, I have written a diary of a typical day here at City Zoo, and have some activities for you to take part in. You never know, you may decide that you would like to be a zookeeper one day&#8230;</p>
