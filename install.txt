Installation:
-------------

Below is an outline of how to install the software on to your Unix machine.

1. Remove the old installation(s) of Adaptive Server Anywhere using
	rm -rf <old_installation_dir>
   where <old_installation_dir> is the directory where Adaptive Server Anywhere
   was previously installed.

2. To install Adaptive Server Anywhere, run "setup" located in the directory
   SYBSasa6 in the directory where you un-tarred the file asa6002linux.tar.gz.
   For example, if you have asa6002linux.tar.gz in /tmp, then run /tmp/SYBSasa6/setup.

   Note:
       During the installation, you will be prompted for the directory
       in which Adaptive Server Anywhere should be installed.
       The default is /opt/SYBSasa6.

3. Add /opt/SYBSasa6/bin to your search path.
   If you installed Sybase Central (Java), then add $SYBASE/sybcentral32/java
   to your search path. Also, make sure that the JRE (Java Runtime Executable)
   is in your search path.
   The README.1ST file that was installed in the /opt/SYBSasa6
   directory has some information on where you can obtain the JRE for Linux.

4. Add /opt/SYBSasa6/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH path.

5. You should now refer to the README.1ST that was installed in the
   /opt/SYBSasa6 directory. This file contains release notes and
   a quick introduction to using Adaptive Server Anywhere.
